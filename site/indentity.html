		<h3>Section1</h3>
		<p>" Magellan’s circumnavigation [of the globe] forever altered the Western world’s ideas about
cosmology – the study of the universe and our place in it – as well as geography. It
demonstrated, among other things, that the earth was round, that the Americas were not part
of India but were actually a separate continent, and that oceans covered most of the earth’s
surface. The voyage conclusively demonstrated that the earth is, after all, one world. But it also
demonstrated that it was a world of unceasing conflict, both natural and human. The cost of
these discoveries in terms of loss of life and suffering was greater than anyone could have
anticipated at the start of the expedition. [The voyagers] had survived an expedition to the ends
of the earth, but more than that, they had endured a voyage into the darkest recesses of the
human soul.  (Lawrence Bergreen, Over the Edge of the World)
During the Civil War era many factions sought to change America. Remarkable speakers spread
their ideas through oratory, thrilling their audiences through powerful speeches that appealed
to both emotion and logic. Frederick Douglass, a black American, fought for black civil rights
through compelling speeches like “What to the slave is the Fourth of July?” which depicted the
terrors of slavery in graphic detail. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, spoke peacefully and
optimistically during his Second Inaugural Address to demonstrate his desire for peace and
reconciliation with the Confederate states. Both speakers captivated their audiences through
persuasive diction, tone, and argumentative methods in an effort to win them over and gain
their support."</p>

excellent health care system. All Canadians have access to medical services at a reasonable
